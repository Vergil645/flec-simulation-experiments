# ABC simulation experiments

This repository contains the environment to run ABC inside NS3-DCE and reproduce its results.

# FlEC simulation experiments

This repository contains the environment to run FlEC inside NS3-DCE and reproduce its results.
We (painfully) ported NS3-DCE to Ubuntu 20.04.
If you just want to have an NS3-DCE docker image without intention to run FlEC, you can just build
the Dockerfile-base-20.04 image.


A huge thanks to [Maxime Piraux](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=DRHOxqwAAAAJ&hl=fr) who wrote most of the NS3 simulation scripts !
